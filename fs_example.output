Set Speed
{ (fast, 0.6), (medium, 0.8), (spin, 0.9) }

Set Pitch
{ (good, 0.4), (fair, 0.5), (rough, 0.2) }

Set Run
{ (low, 0.9), (avg, 1.0), (high, 0.7) }

Relation Speed -> Pitch
{ 
 { (fast, 0.6), (good, 0.4) }, 
 { (fast, 0.6), (fair, 0.5) }, 
 { (fast, 0.6), (rough, 0.2) }, 
 { (medium, 0.8), (good, 0.4) }, 
 { (medium, 0.8), (fair, 0.5) }, 
 { (medium, 0.8), (rough, 0.2) }, 
 { (spin, 0.9), (good, 0.4) }, 
 { (spin, 0.9), (fair, 0.5) }, 
 { (spin, 0.9), (rough, 0.2) } 
}

Relation Pitch -> Run
{ 
 { (good, 0.4), (low, 0.9) }, 
 { (good, 0.4), (avg, 1.0) }, 
 { (good, 0.4), (high, 0.7) }, 
 { (fair, 0.5), (low, 0.9) }, 
 { (fair, 0.5), (avg, 1.0) }, 
 { (fair, 0.5), (high, 0.7) }, 
 { (rough, 0.2), (low, 0.9) }, 
 { (rough, 0.2), (avg, 1.0) }, 
 { (rough, 0.2), (high, 0.7) } 
}

Functional Value for Relation Speed -> Pitch
[[0.4 0.5 0.2]
 [0.4 0.5 0.2]
 [0.4 0.5 0.2]]

Functional Value for Relation Pitch -> Run
[[0.4 0.4 0.4]
 [0.5 0.5 0.5]
 [0.2 0.2 0.2]]

Resultant Functional Value for Relation Speed -> Run
    based on Relation Speed -> Pitch, Pitch -> Run
    using MIN-MAX composition algorithm
[[0.5 0.5 0.5]
 [0.5 0.5 0.5]
 [0.5 0.5 0.5]]

Resultant Functional Value for Relation Speed -> Run
    based on Relation Speed -> Pitch, Pitch -> Run
    using MIN-Product composition algorithm
[[0.25 0.25 0.25]
 [0.25 0.25 0.25]
 [0.25 0.25 0.25]]

DONE.
